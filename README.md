## Flatpack
Flatpack is a zero-config Javascript bundler.

## Features
* ðŸŽ‰ Zero config - Your project gets bundled out of the box without any config files needed. With just one attribute in your `index.html` file's entry point, Flatpack resolves all its dependencies and bundles them completely without the need of writing any tedious configs. It also allows you to eject from this convention by allowing you to provide a config yourself if needed.
* ðŸš€ Production optimized - Flatpack minifies and simplifies your bundle to make it production-ready
